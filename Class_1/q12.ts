//Greetings: Start with the array you used in Exercise 11, but instead of just printing each person’s name, print a message to them. The text of each message should be the same, but each message should be personalized with the person’s name.

let nam = ["Ali", "Hasnain", "Bahlool", "Wasim", "Muhammad"];
for (let i = 0; i < nam.length; i++) {
    console.log("Greetings" + "     " + nam[i]);
}
