//Stripping Names: Store a personâ€™s name, and include some whitespace characters at the beginning and end of the name. Make sure you use each character combination, "\t" and "\n", at least once. Print the name once, so the whitespace around the name is displayed. Then print the name after striping the white spaces.
// Store a person's name with whitespace
const Name = "\tJohn \nDoe\t";

// Print the name with whitespace
console.log("Name with whitespace:");
console.log(Name);

// Remove the whitespace and print the stripped name
const trimmedName = Name.trim();
console.log("\nStripped Name:");
console.log(trimmedName);
